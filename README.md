# ruby_rpi

This is the 2nd, more advanced version of the the voice assistant that I am making in python.

Dependencies:
- (todo)

First, you must configure the config.ini file with the missing api keys, your ip addresses, and passwords, etc.

Run the index.py file to start it. I have it deployed on a raspberry pi 4 that runs all the time.
